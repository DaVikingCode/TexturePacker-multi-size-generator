TexturePacker-multi-size-generator
==================================

Bash utility to generate multi size assets from a .tps file.

Run the script via command line:
`sh assetsGenerator.sh`

Make the script executable:
`chmod +x assetsGenerator.sh`
Then remove its .sh extension, you're now able to run the script via a double click!

Note that the PNGs generated are compressed with [pngquant](http://pngquant.org/). To add pngquant to your CLI, add the executable in `/usr/bin/` on OS X.
